# drumMachineFrontEnd
Front end for Drum Machine project
Drum machine that uses webGL, built for MOd 3 prject at Flatiron school.

Drum machine connects to an API, built in rails and collects drum sounds and connects them into a drum kit.
In the background there is a space scene with 8 spheres to represent each drum pad, this uses the THREE.JS framework.

MVP was to make the drumkit work.
Push goals-
           Add a create drumkit button
           Be able to add sounds
