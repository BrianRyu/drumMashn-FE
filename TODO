Populate the databse with pad sound links...


Create kit,

List all available sounds as Sound_ID with a preview/play button
They should be inside a form with radio buttons
and a submit button, and a drumkit name
Upon submit make sure 8 are selected.

From there first we create a drum kit using the name,
then we do a KitSound create.. using the new drum kit ID,
and the sound ID,
Sound_ID will be an array of 8 chosen sounds.
A forEach sound will create a KitSound with the new drumKit ID

KitSound.create(drumkit_id: kit.id, sound_id: pad_8.id)
